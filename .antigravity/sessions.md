# Long-Term Memory & Project Context

## Overview
This file tracks unique project learnings, specifically patterns and troubleshooting steps discovered during execution that are not already defined in the core project rules (GEMINI.md).

### [2026-03-13 20:12] Session Summary
- **Learned/Decided**: Found that `styled-jsx` in the Next.js App Router environment can cause CSS leakage and inconsistent sizing for absolutely positioned SVGs in production. Decided to migrate such components to pure Tailwind CSS for better build-time stability.
- **Preferences**: The user prefers robust production-grade fixes (even if it means migrating styling libraries) over quick patches when layout issues occur on the deployed site.
- **Plan Impact**: Future UI components should prioritize Tailwind CSS classes over `styled-jsx` to avoid "oversized icon" issues in production. Always add explicit `w-* h-*` classes to SVGs regardless of `width`/`height` attributes.

### [2026-03-14 17:42] Session Summary
- **Learned/Decided**: The user (Azuma) has set a strict "Hands-Hands-Off" rule for `src/app/(frontend)/components/Footer.tsx`. 
- **Preferences**: This file must NEVER be modified unless an explicit instruction for it is given. It is a protected component for now.
- **Plan Impact**: Even if the footer looks broken or inconsistent during other UI tasks, skip it entirely.

### [2026-03-14 15:30] Session Summary
- **Learned/Decided**: 
    - Fixed FOIC (Flash of Invisible Content) by implementing a session-based URL cache in `GcsImage`.
    - Resolved image disappearance on back/forward buttons using `pageshow` event listeners (BFCache).
    - Discovered that hydration flicker is often caused by `finalSrc` mismatches between SSR and Client; unified this using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.
- **Preferences**: 
    - Confirmed green text for Git reports: "Gitプッシュしたで".
- **Plan Impact**: All critical image performance issues are now resolved. Future media-heavy components should leverage the `loadedUrls` pattern.

### [2026-03-14 18:15] Session Summary
- **Learned/Decided**: Adjusted the site-wide base font size to 16px (from 18px). Recalculated blog typography to maintain the Airbnb Newsroom targets on the new base: H1 (46px / 2.875rem), H2 (32px / 2rem), H3/Body (18px / 1.125rem).
- **Preferences**: Azuma prefers keeping specific absolute pixel targets for readability/aesthetics even when the root font size changes.
- **Plan Impact**: Assume a 16px base for all future typography work and use verified rem ratios to hit Airbnb-style targets.

### [2026-03-15 00:32] Session Summary
- **Autonomous UX & Efficiency Mandate**: 
    - The user has authorized the agent to proactively implement UX and efficiency improvements (e.g., caching strategies, navigation fixes, performance optimizations).
    - **Logic-Only Scope**: This mandate applies strictly to back-end logic, API handling, and non-visual client-side logic.
    - **STRICT UI/Styling Restriction**: I am FORBIDDEN from modifying UI design, styling (Tailwind, CSS), or layouts without explicit instructions.
- **Core UX Philosophy**: Azuma places the highest priority on "Instant Load" experiences. "The fastest technology" means 0.1s-0.2s targets. Any lag over 3s is considered a failure.
- **Communication Nuance**: Azuma might occasionally type "クライアント" (Client) when referring to "クラやん" (Kurayan). This should be interpreted as the latter in the "Oje & Kurayan" partner context.
- **Plan Impact**: Technical efficiency is the key. I will always prioritize speed and seamless SPA navigation in all future implementations.

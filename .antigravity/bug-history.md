# Noe Shiftica Bug History

### [2026-03-14 23:45] Bug: Production Image Loading Failure & Slowness
- **Error**: Images were return 404 (Not Found) or 403 (Forbidden) in production. Some remained in 'pending' state forever. Hard refresh caused `ReferenceError: process is not defined`. CORS errors blocked direct GCS fetches.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. Missing critical environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`, `GCS_BUCKET`) in `apphosting.yaml`.
  2. Firebase Storage rules were set to `allow read: if false`, blocking direct CDN access.
  3. Server-side proxying of images via `/api/media/file` caused timeouts and deadlocks (loopback) in Firebase App Hosting's serverless environment.
  4. Using `process.env` directly in client-side hooks without safety checks.
  5. Missing CORS configuration on the GCS bucket for the production domain.
- **File(s) Modified**:
  - `apphosting.yaml`
  - `storage.rules`
  - `src/lib/GcsImage.tsx`
  - `src/collections/Media.ts`
  - `cors.json` (applied via `gsutil`)
- **Fix Summary**:
  - Added necessary environment variables to `apphosting.yaml`.
  - Updated `storage.rules` to allow public read.
  - Implemented `afterRead` hooks in Payload to return direct Firebase Storage CDN URLs globally.
  - Bypassed Next.js and Payload image proxies in production for direct CDN serving.
  - Added safe guards for `process` in `GcsImage.tsx`.
  - Applied CORS policy to allow direct frontend fetches.
- **Prevention Note**:
  - **Environment**: Always triple-check the `apphosting.yaml` environment variables for production.
  - **Performance**: Never proxy binary data (images/videos) through a serverless function in production; use direct CDN/Storage URLs.
  - **Safe Env Checks**: Always use a safe wrapper like `(typeof process !== 'undefined' ? process.env : {})` for client-side environment variable access.
  - **CORS**: Remember to set GCS CORS when moving to direct-from-browser serving.
